# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms – Placement Preparation

This repository documents is my structured **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** preparation as part of my placement journey.

I regularly upload **interview-focused DSA problems**, solved and organized topic-wise, with clean code and clear approaches.  
The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving fundamentals and cover **all major DSA topics asked in technical interviews**.

Each solution is written with:
- Interview-oriented logic
- Optimized time and space complexity
- Clear problem categorization for revision
